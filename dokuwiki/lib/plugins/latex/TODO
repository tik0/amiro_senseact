-ODT export looks fugly due to grainy equations and large fonts, but maybe people never use those massive fonts in practice?
	-overrendering Latex images then shrinking them with width/height tags makes the HTML version look ugly instead (no smoothing).
-SVG support? 
	-use pdf2svg?
	-use dvisvgm? output seems weird on my first try at it.
	-firefox 3.6.15 (for example) does not support SVG in image tags, but firefox 4 does.
		- using object tag instead means no tooltip text, no linking.
	-perhaps a bit premature.
-MimeTex support
	-shouldn't be too hard to hack in. need to check if it supports \begin{} \end{} environments.
-\includegraphics support will work if one puts a \graphicspath line in the preamble...
  - that could be keyed into the current namespace; but on second thought, that
	  breaks the idea of having images tagged by checksum (it would depend in which
		namespace the equation is compiled). instead, admins should just make \graphicspath
		manually and set it to a specific shared point, in a small wiki.
