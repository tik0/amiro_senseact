====== Building the Braitenberg vehicle for AMiRo, which avoids edges on the table ======

This is a demo of the braitenberg with obstacle and edge avoidance.
IMPORTANT: Make sure that you measured IR offsets of the ground and of the air (see [[demo:initial:start|initial demo]]). Otherwise the robot isn't able to stop in front of edges!

===== Run the Demo =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh <ip address>''
  - ''./run.sh'' on the AMiRo
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.11 / --style monitor'' to inspect the communication

===== Included Programs =====
