====== Building the Open Challenge 2015 Environment for AMiRo ======

This is a demo of the braitenberg with obstacle and edge avoidence.
IMPORTANT: Make sure that you measured IR offsets of the ground and of the air (see demo "initial"). Otherwise the robot isn't able to stop in front of edges!

===== Run the simulation =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh''
  - ''./run.sh'' on the AMiRo
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.11 / --style monitor'' to inspect the communication
