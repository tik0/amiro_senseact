====== Building the CoreSLAM Environment for AMiRo ======

This is a demo which streams the local camera device via RSB and displays it with another process.
It only consists of two applications.
One for opening the camera device, compressing the image and sending it via RSB.
And another which grabs the compressed images from the RSB scope and display them via OpenCV

===== Run the demo =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh''
  - ''./run.sh'' on the AMiRo
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.11 / --style monitor'' to inspect the communication
