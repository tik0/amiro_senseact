====== Building the Harvester Choreo ======

This demo contains the program for performing a choreography on the AMiRo. For this purpose a xml file, that defines the choreography, is parsed. Additionally several robots can communicate and cooperate with each other and adapt their movements.

For detailed application and procedure information, please check the [[process:actingBehavior:twbChoreo:twbChoreo:start|TWB Choreo documentation]].

Additionally choreo corrections can be sent. Please check the [[process:actingBehavior:twbChoreo:twbChoreoCorrection:start|Choreo Correction documentation]] for more details.

===== Run the Demo =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copySpecific.sh <ip address>'' (only once!)*
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh <ip address>''
  - Change to AMiRo console
  - Modify the parameters in ''runAMiRo.sh'' (robot ID, marker ID, positions, etc.) on every robot!
  - ''./runAMiRo.sh'' on the AMiRo
  - If every AMiRo is running:
    - Change to command directory on one AMiRo: ''cd commands/''
    - If they recognized each other: ''init.sh''
    - If they shall start the choreo: ''start.sh''
    - If they shall break the choreo: ''break.sh''
    - If the choreos are broken and shall be continued: ''start.sh''
    - If they shall stop the choreo (or stop program): ''stop.sh''
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.13 --style monitor /'' to inspect the communication

*) This has to be done only once for every robot. The copied files are modified on every robot.

===== Do Choreo Correction =====

After executing the run script on the AMiRo, run ''runCorrection.sh <robot ID> <marker ID>'' in a different console. By hitting the enter key, the robot will be given choreo corrections.
