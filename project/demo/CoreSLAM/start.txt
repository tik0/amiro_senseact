====== Building the CoreSLAM Environment for AMiRo ======

This is a [[process:mapping:CoreSLAM:start|CoreSLAM]] demonstration which runs with the Hokuyo URG04-LX.
The map is periodically send as an jpg image to the scope ''--mapAsImageOutScope /AMiRo_Hokuyo/image'', which can be displayed by [[tools:hmi:showCamJpg:start|showCamJpg]].
AMiRo is steered via remote keyboard commands from you PC using [[tools:hmi:sendControlsVecInt:start|sendControls]] which sends it commands to the scope ''/motor''.

===== Run the demo =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh''
  - ''./run.sh'' on the AMiRo
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping

===== Included Programs =====
