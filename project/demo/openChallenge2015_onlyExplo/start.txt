====== Building the Open Challenge 2015 Environment for AMiRo ======

This is a simulation of the statemachine of the AMiRo for the Open Challenge.
The scenario is the delivery of goods from a table to a position from where ToBI can grab them. Here the AMiRo won't do real object detection!


===== Build and copying the simulation =====

  - ''. ./build.sh''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh <IP>''


===== Run the simulation on the AMiRo =====

Start all programs with a specific robot ID
  - ''./run.sh <robot ID>''

If you like to stop
  - ''./stop.sh''


===== Run it for real =====

Comment the programm start of "answerer_tobi" at the end of the start script "run.sh". This program simulates the communication of ToBI and shouldn't run, if you are using the real ToBI.


===== Other tips =====

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.11 / --style monitor'' to inspect the communication
