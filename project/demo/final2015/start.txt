====== Building the RoboCup@Home 2015 Final for AMiRo ======

This demo is the application for the RoboCup@Home 2015 Final and works together with ToBI. By giving commands, the AMiRo can follow ToBI or serve as a waypoint.

===== Run the demo =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh <IP address>''
  - ''./run.sh <robot ID>'' on the AMiRo
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.11 / --style monitor'' to inspect the communication

===== AMiRo Order =====

Setup of ToBI and the AMiRos:

ToBI <- AMiRo ID 1 <- AMiRo ID 0

===== Simulate the Communication from Tobi =====

  - Log into the AMiRo
  - Go to the folder ''~/final2015/sim''
  - ''./simStateInitFollow.sh <ID>'' (AMiRo with the given ID {0,1} is now following the device ahead)
  - ''./simStateInitWaypoint.sh <ID>'' (AMiRo with the given ID {0,1} stops, saves the environment and detects the movements in the surrounding)
  - ''./simStateStopWaypoint.sh <ID>'' (AMiRo with the given ID {0,1} stops the detection the movements in the surrounding)
  - ''./simStateInitFollow.sh <ID>'' (AMiRo with the given ID {0,1} is now following again)
  - ''./simStateStopFollow.sh <ID>'' (AMiRo with the given ID {0,1} halts)
