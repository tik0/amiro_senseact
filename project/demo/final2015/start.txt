====== Building the Final 2015 Environment for AMiRo ======

This is a demo works together with Tobi.
The scenario is the following of Tobi until a waypoint is reached, and sending status information about the point of interest.

Setup of Tobi and the AMiRos:

Tobi <- AMiRo ID1 <- AMiRo ID0

===== Run the demo =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh''
  - ''./run.sh'' on the AMiRo
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.11 / --style monitor'' to inspect the communication

===== Simulate the Communication from Tobi =====

  - Log into the AMiRo
  - Go to the folder ''~/final2015/sim''
  - ''./simStateInitFollow.sh <ID>'' (AMiRo with the given ID {0,1} is now following the device ahead)
  - ''./simStateInitWaypoint.sh <ID>'' (AMiRo with the given ID {0,1} stops, saves the environment and detects the movements in the surrounding)
  - ''./simStateStopWaypoint.sh <ID>'' (AMiRo with the given ID {0,1} stops the detection the movements in the surrounding)
  - ''./simStateInitFollow.sh <ID>'' (AMiRo with the given ID {0,1} is now following again)
  - ''./simStateStopFollow.sh <ID>'' (AMiRo with the given ID {0,1} halts)
