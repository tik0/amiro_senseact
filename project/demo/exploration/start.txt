====== Building the Frontier Exploration for AMiRo ======

This is a demo which runs map building with Frontier Exploration for the isy project 2015.

===== Run the demo =====


    - ''cmake .''
    - ''make''
    - ''./scpall.sh root@[AMiRoAdress]:~''
    - Start a local spread on the AMiRo
    - Start another spread (global spread) on the AMiRo that connects to the spread from the tracking
    - Make sure that there is an rsb.conf that refers to the local spread on the AMiRo
    - Adapt the port in the startscript to match the global spread
    - Adapt the id in the startscript to match the marker id of the robot
    - ''./startExplo.sh'' on the AMiRo
    - ''./stopExplo.sh'' to stop the exploration (this does not kill the spreads)


To view the map use the program [[tools:showMap:start|showMap]].
