====== Building the Open Challenge 2015 Environment for AMiRo ======

This is a simulation of the statemachine of the AMiRo for the Open Challenge.
The scenario is the delivery of goods from a table to a position from where Tobi can grab them.

This can be improved by real programs!

===== Run the simulation =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh''
  - ''./run.sh'' on the AMiRo
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.11 / --style monitor'' to inspect the communication
