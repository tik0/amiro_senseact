====== Building the GEPTRO Table Application Environment for AMiRo ======

This is the GEPTRO Table Application. The AMiRo explores the table and detects all objects. Afterwards it delivers a requested object. For more detailed behavior information, please check the [[process:stateMachineGEPTRO:start|GEPTRO statemachine]].

===== Run the project =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh <IP address>''
  - ''./run.sh'' on the AMiRo
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.11 / --style monitor'' to inspect the communication
