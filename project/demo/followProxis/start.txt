====== Building the Following by Proximity Sensor Behavior ======

This is a demo of the following behavior only based on the proximity sensors.
IMPORTANT: Make sure that you measured IR offsets of the ground and of the air (see [[demo:initial:start|initial demo]]). Otherwise the robot isn't able to follow well!

===== Run the Demo =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh <ip address>''
  - ''./run.sh'' on the AMiRo
  - Use the scripts ''./follow.sh'' and ''./wait.sh'' for starting and stopping the following behavior
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.11 / --style monitor'' to inspect the communication
