====== Running a Simulator Demo with CoreSLAM ======

This is a demo shows a working simulator with one AMiRo and a [[demo:CoreSLAMSim:start|CoreSLAMSim]] implementation.
It only consists of three applications.
One, the [[simulation:start|simulator]] itself, which offers all interfaces to a simulated AMiRo and its lidar.
Two, a programm [[tools:hmi:sendControlsProtoTwist:start|sendTwistControls]], which allows by wasd controll to steer the robot.
At last, the [[demo:CoreSLAMSim:start|CoreSLAMSim]] implementation, which reads the lidar scans and the odometry to do the mapping and localisation.


The demo can also be run with a tilted lidar to scan the floor.
You have to use ''./run_tilted.sh'' instead of ''./run.sh''.

===== Run the demo =====

  - Make shure that the gazebo plugins are compiled: ''cd ./murox_dev/project/simulation/gazebo_rsb_pkgs/gazebo_plugins && cmake . && make all''
  - Now build the CoreSLAMSIM project (Note: Maybe you have to use ''ninja'' instead of ''make'' to resolve all the dependecies)
  - ''cmake .''
  - ''make''
  - ''./run.sh'' for running the demo
  - Hit the wasd buttons for steering or space to stop
  - ''./stop.sh'' for stopping the demo

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.11 / --style monitor'' to inspect the communication
