====== Building the RoboCup@Home 2015 OpenChallenge for AMiRo ======

This is the RoboCup@Home 2015 OpenChallenge. The AMiRo explores the table and detects all objects. Afterwards it delivers a requested object to its start position. For more detailed behavior information, please check the [[process:stateMachineGEPTRO:start|OpenChallenge statemachine]].

===== Run the project =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh <IP address>''
  - ''./background.sh'' on the AMiRo (starting programs like object detection, which needs much time to load the object images)
  - ''./run.sh'' on the AMiRo
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping
  - ''./backgroundStop.sh'' on the AMiRo (stopping everything, which has been started with ''background.sh'')

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.11 / --style monitor'' to inspect the communication
