  - ''./copyPrograms.sh''
  - ''./runIRConfig.sh'' on the AMiRo for calculating the table offsets
                         (make sure that the AMiRo is standing on the table without any objects in range)
  - ''./runIREmpty.sh'' on the AMiRo for calculating the air offsets
                        (make sure that the AMiRo has nothing in range including the table)
