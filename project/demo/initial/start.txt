====== Building the Initial Project for AMiRo ======

This is a demo which works together with Tobi.
The scenario is the delivery of goods from a table to a position from where Tobi can grab them.

===== Build and Copy the Demo =====

  - ''./build.sh''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh <IP address>''
  - Use the "-h" option for detailed information about usage of the programs [[tools:edgeMeasurement:start|edgeMeasurement]] and [[sense:senseRingProximity:start|senseRingProximity]].

===== Calculating the Sensor Offsets for the rirReader =====

For the [[process:rirReader:start|rirReader]] this tool can calculate the ground and air offsets for the [[includes:sensorModels:startVCNL4020|sensor obstacle and edge model]] (for specific measurements, please also check the [[tools:measureOffsetTest:start|measureOffsetTest documentation]]):
  - ''./runIRConfig.sh'' on the AMiRo for calculating the ground offsets (make sure that the AMiRo is standing on the table without any objects in range)
  - ''./runIREmpty.sh'' on the AMiRo for calculating the air offsets (make sure that the AMiRo has nothing in range including the table)
