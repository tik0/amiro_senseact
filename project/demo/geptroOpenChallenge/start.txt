====== Building the GEPTRO Table Application Environment for AMiRo ======

This is the GEPTRO Table Application. The AMiRo explores the table and detects all objects. Afterwards it delivers a requested object. For more detailed behavior information, please check the [[process:stateMachineGEPTRO:start|GEPTRO statemachine]].

===== Run the project =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh <IP address>''
  - ''./backgroundStart.sh'' on the AMiRo (starting programs like object detection, which needs much time to load the object images)
  - ''./run.sh'' on the AMiRo
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping
  - ''./allStop.sh'' on the AMiRo (stopping everything, which has been started with ''background.sh'')

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.11 / --style monitor'' to inspect the communication

===== Problem with Transport =====

For the final application, the robots should also transport objects on top of them. The behavior and communication is written in the [[process:transport:start|transport project]], but it couldn't be included due to realization problems in this demo. Finally, altough the transport project is functional, the robots only delivered objects by pushing them.
