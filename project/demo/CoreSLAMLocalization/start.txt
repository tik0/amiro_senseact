====== Building the CoreSLAMLocalization for AMiRo ======

This is a [[process:localization:CoreSLAMLocalization:start|CoreSLAMLocalization]] demonstration which runs with the Hokuyo URG04-LX.
The map is periodically send as an jpg image to the scope ''--mapAsImageOutScope /AMiRo_Hokuyo/image'', which can be displayed by [[tools:hmi:showCamJpg:start|showCamJpg]].
AMiRo is steered via remote keyboard commands from your PC using [[tools:hmi:keyboardControlledBehavior|keyboardControlledBehavior]] which sends it commands to the scope ''/motor''.

===== Run the demo =====

  - ''./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh $IP_OF_AMIRO''
  - ''./run.sh'' on the AMiRo
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping
  - Note: the next steps require running ''spread -c amirospread''
  - optionally showing the map your PC using ''./show-map.sh''
  - the AMiRo can be controlled by running ''./keyboard-control.sh'' and using WASD keys
  - the appropiate RSB command for homing can send by running ''./homing.sh'' on your PC
  - exporting the map can be done by running ''./save-map.sh $FILE_NAME''. It will be saved on the AMiRo as ''$FILE_NAME'' (defaulting to: ''map.pgm'').

===== Included Programs =====

^ Program ^ Description ^
| [[process:localization:CoreSLAMLocalization:start|CoreSLAMLocalization]] | The core component of this demo: localization based on CoreSLAM. |
| [[sense:sendOdometryProtoPose:start|sendOdometryProtoPose]] | This program provides odometry data for the CoreSLAM. |
| [[sense:senseHokuyo:start|senseHokuyo]] | Publishes scans by the Hokuyo Laser Scanner, which are also used by CoreSLAM. |
| [[act:actAmiroMotor:start|actAmiroMotor]] | Program for reading steering vectors from a RSB scope and send them via CAN as motor commands. This is necessary for ''keyboardControlledBehavior''. |
| [[act:actTargetPosition:start|actTargetPosition]] | Program for reading target positions from a RSB scope and forwarding them via CAN to ''setTargetPosition''. It is used to drive along a path provided by the path planner, e.g. homing. |
| [[tools:robotTools:stopAMiRo:start.txt|stopAMiRo]] | A utility program to gracefully stop the AMiRo when the demo is stopped. |
