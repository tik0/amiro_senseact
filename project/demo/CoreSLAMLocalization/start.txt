====== Building the CoreSLAMLocalization for AMiRo ======

This is a [[process:localization:CoreSLAMLocalization:start|CoreSLAMLocalization]] demonstration which runs with the Hokuyo URG04-LX.
The map is periodically send as an jpg image to the scope ''--mapAsImageOutScope /AMiRo_Hokuyo/image'', which can be displayed by [[tools:hmi:showCamJpg:start|showCamJpg]].
AMiRo is steered via remote keyboard commands from your PC using [[tools:hmi:keyboardControlledBehavior|keyboardControlledBehavior]] which sends it commands to the scope ''/motor''.

===== Run the demo =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh IP_OF_AMIRO''
  - ''./run.sh'' on the AMiRo
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping
  - Note: the next bullets require running ''spread -c amirospread''
  - optionally showing the map your PC using ''./show-map.sh''
  - the AMiRo can be controlled by running ''./keyboard-control.sh' and using WASD keys
  - the appropiate RSB command for homing can send by running ''./homing.sh'' on your PC
  - exporting the map can be done by running ''./save-map.sh'. It will be saved on the AMiRo as ''map.pgm''.
