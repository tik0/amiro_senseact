====== Building the Braitenberg vehicle for AMiRo ======

This is a demo of the braitenberg with obstacle and edge avoidence. In this case the [[process:braitenberg:start|braitenberg behavior]] is used. 

IMPORTANT: Make sure that you measured IR offsets of the ground and of the air (see [[demo:initial:start|initial demo]]). Otherwise the robot isn't able to stop in front of edges and obstacles!

===== Run the Demo =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh <ip address>''
  - Run on the AMiRo with
    * ''./runStandard.sh'' for standard braitenberg behavior (the robot turns in front of every edge and obstacle)
    * ''./runObstacleStop.sh'' for stopping in front of obstacles (the robot turns in front of edges and continues driving)
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.11 / --style monitor'' to inspect the communication

===== Included Programs =====

^ Program ^ Description ^
| [[process:braitenberg:start|braitenberg]] | Program of braitenberg behavior. |
| [[process:frontObjectDetection:frontObjectDetection:start|frontObjectDetection]] | Program of object detection in front of the robot by suing the proximity sensors. |
| [[sense:senseRingProximity:start|senseRingProximity]] | Program for reading ring proximity values. |
| [[tools:stopAMiRo:start|stopAMiRo]] | Program for stopping the AMiRo (stopping motors and resetting lights). |
