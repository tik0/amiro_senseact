====== Building the Braitenberg vehicle for AMiRo which avoids edges on the tabele ======

This is a demo of the braitenberg with obstacle and edge avoidence. In this case the braitenberg behavior is used in front of edges. If there is detected an obstacle, the AMiRo will stop and try to mark it.
IMPORTANT: Make sure that you measured IR offsets of the ground and of the air (see [[demo:initial:start|initial demo]]). Otherwise the robot isn't able to stop in front of edges!

===== Run the Demo =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh <ip address>''
  - ''./run.sh'' on the AMiRo
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.11 / --style monitor'' to inspect the communication
