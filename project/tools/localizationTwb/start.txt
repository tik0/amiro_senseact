====== localizationTwb ======

This program is a standalone binary, which uses the Stemmer Imaging API, and therefor their hardware, in combination with OpenCV and ARToolKit for tracking robots in the camera frame.
The setup of the TeleWorkBench (TWB) as seen below is used for tracking the marker on the robots, and publishing their coordinates and orientation via RSB.

The coordinate system, in which the robots are tracked, resides in the camera.
Therefore, all orientations and locations are in respect to the camera frame.

Below, a live top view of the tracking system can be seen.
The recognized marker on top of the robots are highlighted by yellow rectangulars.
The coordinates, which are also published by RSB can be seen in the console window on the bottom left.

The pose of the robots is published by RSB in an specific list, where all found markers reside.
They are stored in a list as follow:
<source includes/types/twbTracking.proto c|twbTracking.proto>


===== Installation =====

  - Install the Stemmer Imaging API from [[tools:stemmerImagingGrabberExample:start|this]] example
