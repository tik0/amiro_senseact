  • updates, 
  • supplements, 
  • support services
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items.  If so, those terms apply.
BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.  IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.  
IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW FOR EACH LICENSE YOU ACQUIRE.
1. OVERVIEW.
a. Software.  The software includes development tools, software programs and documentation.
b. License Model.  The software is licensed on a per user basis.
2. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

5. SCOPE OF LICENSE.  The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software.  Kappa reserves all other rights.  Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement.  In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
  • work around any technical limitations in the software;
  • reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;

8. NOT FOR RESALE SOFTWARE.  You may not sell software marked as “NFR” or “Not for Resale.”
9. UPGRADE.  If this software is marked as an upgrade version, you may use it only if you have a license to use the software eligible for upgrade.  If you upgrade, this software takes the place of the earlier version, and this agreement takes the place of the agreement for that earlier version.  You may use the earlier version only as permitted in the Downgrade clause below.  
10. TRANSFER TO A THIRD PARTY.  The first user of the software may transfer it, and this agreement, directly to a third party.  Before the transfer, that party must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software.  The first user must uninstall the software before transferring it separately from the device.  The first user may not retain any copies.
11. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  The software is subject to German export laws and regulations.  You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software.  These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use.
12. SUPPORT SERVICES.  Kappa provides support services for the software.
13. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.
14. APPLICABLE LAW.
a. United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Californian state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.  The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
b. Outside the United States.  If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.
15. LEGAL EFFECT.  This agreement describes certain legal rights.  You may have other rights under the laws of your state or country.  You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software.  This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your state or country if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.
16. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES.  YOU CAN RECOVER FROM KAPPA AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to
  • anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
  • claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if
  • repair, replacement or a refund for the software does not fully compensate you for any losses; or
  • Kappa knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.
Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.  They also may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages. 
If the software has been acquired in Germany or Austria the limitation mentioned in article 16 of these terms does not apply. Instead, and regardless of the legal ground (incl. unlawful act), the following regulations for compensation and reimbursement of expenses apply:
In the case of intent, gross negligence, claims according to Product Liability Law and injuries to body, life or health, Kappa will be liable according to the provisions of law.
Kappa will not be liable in the case of slight negligence. If, however, the software has been acquired in Germany, Kappa will also be liable in case of slight negligence if Kappa infringes an essential contractual obligation. In these cases Kappa’s liability is limited to typical and foreseeable damages. In all other cases of slight negligence, Kappa will not be liable even though the software has been acquired in Germany.
