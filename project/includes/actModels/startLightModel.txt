====== Light Model ======

The Light Model contains all constants, which are used for lighting the LEDs. This includes the initial color set and the commands for the [[act:setLights:start|setLights tool]].

Notice: In the ''CMakeLists.txt'' of your project the reference to the Color Source (''Color.cpp'') has to be given to use this interface!

===== Initial Colors =====

When the AMiRo starts, it has an initial color set. By using the vector ''initColors'' the LEDs can be reset to their initial value.

===== Commands and Periods =====

By using the tool [[act:setLights:start|setLights]] the LEDs' colors and lighting type can be set. Their are 7 different lighting types. Each type has its minimal period time due to CAN communication.

^ Type ^ Period Time ^ Period Time Name ^ Description ^
| INIT        | -      | -                | Sets the initial colors (see vector ''initColors''). |
| SHINE       | -      | -                | Sets the given color(s) and lets it just shine. |
| BLINK       | 200 ms | MIN_TIME_BLINK   | Sets the given color(s) and blinks with all LEDs turned on or off. |
| WARNING     | 400 ms | MIN_TIME_WARNING | Sets the given color(s) and blinks with always the left or right half turned on or off. |
| CROSSED     | 400 ms | MIN_TIME_CROSSED | Sets the given color(s) and blinks with only 4 crossed LEDs at once turned on. |
| CIRCLELEFT  | 800 ms | MIN_TIME_CIRCLED | Sets the given color(s) and lets circle two LEDs turned on to the left (counter clockwise). |
| CIRCLERIGHT | 800 ms | MIN_TIME_CIRCLED | Sets the given color(s) and lets circle two LEDs turned on to the right (clockwise). |

===== Functions =====

There are two functions, which build the integer vector for the [[act:setLights:start|setLights tool]] out of the lighting type, the period time and out of one or 8 colors:

^ Function ^ Description ^
| setLight2Vec  | Creates integer vector for [[act:setLights:start|setLights tool]] with only one color. |
| setLights2Vec | Creates integer vector for [[act:setLights:start|setLights tool]] with 8 colors. |
