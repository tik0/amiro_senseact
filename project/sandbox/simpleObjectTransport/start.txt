====== Simple Object Transport ======

In this task the robot just drives from edge to edge to transport objects:

  - Drive to next table edge
  - Turn to get the table edge direct behind
  - Wait for transport command
  - Drive to next table edge
  - Wait for restart command
  - Turn to get the table edge direct behind
  - Restart from the beginning

===== Build Program =====

  - ''cmake .''
  - ''make''

===== RSB Scopes =====

^ Name ^ Default Scope ^ Description ^
| Obstacle Values    | /rir_prox/obstacle | Inscope for receiving proximity sensor values for obstacle model. |
| Edge Values        | /rir_prox/ground   | Inscope for receiving proximity sensor values for edge model. |
| Command Input      | /transport/command | Inscope for receiving commands. |
| Answers and Status | /transport/answer  | Outscope for sending command answers and status messages. |

===== Status Messages =====

^ Command ^ Type ^ Scope Name ^ Description ^
| "ready"       | String | Answers and Status | If the robot is waiting for starting the transport. |
| "transported" | String | Answers and Status | If the robot just transported and waits for restarting the task. |

===== Commands =====

^ Command ^ Type ^ Scope Name ^ Description ^
