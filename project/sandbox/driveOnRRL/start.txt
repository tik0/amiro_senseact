====== Navigation based on RRL ======

This navigation is based on the Robot Robot Localization (RRL) data

===== Building =====

This is a cmake project, so just type:
  - ''cmake .''
  - ''make''

===== Basic Communication =====

On the Tracking Scope the robot gets its current position. It navigates to (some kind) given position. While distance and angle to the reference robot are given, the robot has to calculate its position in the room (translation from polar system to kartesian system) and has to estimate its direction.
