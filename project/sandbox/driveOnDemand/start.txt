====== Drive On Demand ======

The robot drives to a guided position while navigating on given tracking positions. The guided position and the lights can be set via RSB

===== Building =====

This is a cmake project, so just type:
  - ''cmake .''
  - ''make''

===== Basic Communication =====

On the Tracking Scope the robot gets its current position. It navigates to the guided position, which is given by the Guide Input Scope. While driving and executing, the robot gives some status updates about itself via the Status Scope.

Additionally the robot can get commands via the Command Scope:
^ Command ^ Description ^
| stop | The robot will stop and exit the program. |
