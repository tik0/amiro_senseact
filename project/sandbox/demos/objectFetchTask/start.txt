====== Building the Object Fetch Task ======

The robot focusses the nearest object, which can be detected with a laser scanner or a RGBD camera. Afterwards it drives around this object and pushs it to the robot's start position. The navigation is only based on odometry.

For (re)starting the fetching procedure, the robot has to be taken from the table and set on any position.

Please have a look into the [[sandbox:objectFetchTask:start|objectFetchTask documentation]] for detailed application and procedure information.

===== Run the Demo =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh <ip address>''
  - Run on the AMiRo:
    - with Hokuyo Laser Scanner: ''runWithHokuyo.sh''
    - with RGBD Camera (e.g. Orbbec or Asus): ''runWithRGBDCamera.sh''
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.11 / --style monitor'' to inspect the communication
