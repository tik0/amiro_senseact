====== Building the Harvester Choreo ======

This demo contains the program for performing a choreography on the AMiRo as an Harvester movement. For this purpose a xml file, that defines the choreography, is parsed. Additionally several robots can communicate and cooperate with each other and adapt their movements.

For detailed application and procedure information, please check the [[sandbox:harvesterChoreo:start|harvesterChoreo documentation]].

===== Run the Demo =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh <ip address>''
  - ''./run.sh <ID>'' on the AMiRo
  - If every AMiRo is running:
    - Change to command directory on one AMiRo: ''cd commands/''
    - If they recognized each other: ''init.sh''
    - If they shall start choreo: ''start.sh''
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.11 / --style monitor'' to inspect the communication
