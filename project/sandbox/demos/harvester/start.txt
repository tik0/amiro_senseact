====== Building the Harvester Choreo ======

This demo contains the program for performing a choreography on the AMiRo as an Harvester movement. For this purpose a xml file, that defines the choreography, is parsed. Additionally several robots can communicate and cooperate with each other and adapt their movements.

For detailed application and procedure information, please check the [[sandbox:harvesterChoreo:start|harvesterChoreo documentation]].

Additionally choreo corrections can be sent. Please check the [[sandbox:harvesterCorrectChoreo:start|harvesterCorrectChoreo documentation]] for more details.

===== Run the Demo =====

  - ''. ./build.sh .''
  - ''./copyPrograms.sh <ip address>''
  - ''./run.sh <robot ID> <marker ID>'' on the AMiRo
  - If every AMiRo is running:
    - Change to command directory on one AMiRo: ''cd commands/''
    - If they recognized each other: ''init.sh''
    - If they shall start the choreo: ''start.sh''
    - If they shall break the choreo: ''break.sh''
    - If the choreos are broken and shall be continued: ''start.sh''
    - If they shall stop the choreo (or stop program): ''stop.sh''
  - ''./stop.sh'' on the AMiRo for stopping

One could use ''rsb-loggercpp0.13 --style monitor /'' to inspect the communication

===== Do Choreo Correction =====

After executing the run script on the AMiRo, run ''runCorrection.sh <robot ID> <marker ID>'' in a different console. By hitting the enter key, the robot will be given choreo corrections.
