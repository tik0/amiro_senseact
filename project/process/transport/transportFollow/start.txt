====== Transport Follow ======

This tool is the following behavior of the transport scenario, which is described in the [[process:transport:start|transport documentation]]. Basically the robot follows another robot by only using its proximity sensors.

===== Building =====

This is a cmake project, so just type:
  - ''cmake .''
  - ''make''

===== Basic Functionality of the Scenario =====



===== Following Behavior =====
