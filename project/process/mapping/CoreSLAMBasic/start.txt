====== CoreSLAMBasic ======

This program is a the tinySLAM implementation for the RoboCup 2015.

The Program listens on the scope ''/exploration'' with which you can control an internal statemachine.
The controler starts in an idle state and you can switch by sending strings to it:

  - ''start'' or ''slam'' Switch to the SLAM
  - ''finish'' or ''localization'' Switch to localization
  - ''idle'' Switch to idle mode
  - ''<anyString>'' Remein in current state
