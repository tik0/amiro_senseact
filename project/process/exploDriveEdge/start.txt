This is a x86 program for driving along two edges on a table. It isn't controlling its distance to the edge next to it while driving, so the robot won't drive extactly next to the edge!

It starts its behavior on rsb command (type string) and sends if it's finished (type string):
* Start: send "start" over RSB scope "/explodrive/command"
* Listen to RSB scope "/explodrive/answer"
  -> on "finished" the program finished without any problems
  -> on "broken" the program has stopped due to some problems (e.g. rirReader doesn't send any sensor values anymore)
* After finishing movement (in both cases if really finished or broken) the programs waits for next start command

Compile: cmake . && make
Programs needed: rirReader which should send the ring proximity sensor values over the scopes "/rir_prox/obstacle" and "/rir_prox/ground"
Run program: exploDriveEdge
